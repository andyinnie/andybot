# andybot

Source code for the @andyinnie-test#5431 Discord bot using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). For personal use in my own servers.

Design is highly modular, with on-the-fly module reloading for seamless development.

You can DM me on Discord @andyinnie#3428 with questions or comments.
